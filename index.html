         We all aware of Wrong practices like rape, dowry, racism, body shaming, cast system, gender descrimination[other than male and femals also] etc.
          We'll think that the generation is aware of every situation but that's not true they still make mistakes because
           of lack of knowledge, a mistake that force them to take wrong step. i.e why Sex education is important but still people
           dont talk about it much and even if they want to they feel hesitated to use word sex. so we want to create a healthy mindset of the new generation
           where they could differentiante between good and bad practices and Make our world better.

        case we've mentioned above also these videos will work as a guidance for those parents or people who wants to
        talk about sex but dont know how ? We will also provide sex education to all
        age group accordingly, for kids we will describe it in a manner which will not direct it towards sex but will
        clear the concept & will tell them about pros and cons of every situation they might face. We also connect
         schools and universities with us and organize events for them so that we could reach as many as people possible.
