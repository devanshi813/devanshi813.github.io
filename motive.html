         We know that Rape cases are increasing day by day. We think that in modern world people don't care about dowry system,
         Racism, gender descrimination but that is not true even in this time if we go in depth we can find such activies happenning
         in large scale and people support it either. We think young generation is aware about sex education they know how to handle
         situations but still they make mistakes which lead them to take step like suicide attempt.
         When they make such mistakes they dont know how to talk and whom to talk that is why parents should talk to thier Kids
         and should create a free space between them but some parents just dont know to talk even if they want to.

        <br>
        <br>

        To solve these kinds of problems we are making and uploading animated videos on every case we have discussed above.
        Animated videos are more interactive for the kids. why are we focusing on kids because  Its hard to change the
        mentality of society because they're living with these thoughts since they're born but we can shape the mindset
        of our new generation so that these practices wont be repeated in future.These videos
      will also work as a guidance for those parents who wants to talk about sex but dont know how ? We will also
         provide sex education to all age group accordingly, for kids we will decribe it in a manner which will not direct
          it towards sex but will clear the concept & will tell them about pros and cons of every situation they might face.
           We will connects schools and universities with us and organize events for them so that we could reach as many people.

        <br>
        <br>

        We believe  that this coming generation is our future through this not today, not tomorrow but one day this generation will create
         an impact because their mindset would be different. We're not saying that everyone will change but if we could
         change the mindset of even 10 we would feel blessed.
